/* Hi there! Thanks for checking out my portfolio template. Be sure to read the comments to get a better understanding of
how to make this template work best for you! */

export const colors = ["rgb(0,255,164)", "rgb(166,104,255)"];
/*
I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.
 */

/*
So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.
